giving everything an eerie, macabre appearance.

The walls are hot to the touch,
and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other sounds.
Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead
are myriad twisted formations composed of pure white alabaster,
which scatter the murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.

To one side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock
which seems to have been crafted by the devil himself.

An immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the volcano,
burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.
<<pause>>
To the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles ominously.
