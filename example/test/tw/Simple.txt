	Okay, you started!

	Printing a number: <<print $x>>

Let's display an image:

Hello! This is a "quick-and-dirty" demo of twee2sam.

:: The end

This is a really long string to see how the 512 char limit is being handled by the engine. You see, on SAM, strings are kept on a character buffer on RAM, that are later sent to the screen; this char buffer has a 512 byte limit. Of course, if things come to that, you can always use the 'pause' macro to immediately display the current text to the screen. 
For now, twee2sam will be simply cutting off the excess, in order to prevent the SAM interpreter from crashing. A more appropriate correction will hopefully be implemented later.

<<pause>>
Congratulations, this is the end.


:: Second option
[img[Right.png]]
So, you prefer the second option?

As you can see, the system supports images, though you'll have to properly convert them to the SMS pallete in order for them to work.
