======

This tool is intended to convert [Twee] projects (that you can export from [Twine]) into [SAM] projects. With it, it's possible to create Sega Master System adventure games using Twine.

Currently, it supports a subset of the Twine commands; so far, only links and images are supported.

You can see a working example at example/simple; run Compile.bat to make it run ([Python] must be in your path).
